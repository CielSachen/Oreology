___

A basic mod that adds new building blocks and items.

This mod was originally made to have the golden helmet crown texture as its own aesthetic item so my friends and I can use it along with a more reasonable helmet, but it has since evolved into adding custom items that we feel like having and custom blocks for our building projects.
